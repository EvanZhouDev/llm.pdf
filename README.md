## Inspiration and Credits

This was inspired originally by [ading2210's DoomPDF](https://github.com/ading2210/doompdf), and it's source inpsired many of the compilation flags for llm.pdf.

Thank you to [rahuldshetty's llm.js](https://github.com/rahuldshetty/llm.js) for providing the original idea of compiling llama.cpp into JS.

Shoutout to Pythia [EleutherAI's pythia models](https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia), [Ronen Eldan and Yuanzhi Li's TinyStories LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759), as well as [arnir0's Tiny-LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759) for providing the small LLMs that power llm.pdf.
